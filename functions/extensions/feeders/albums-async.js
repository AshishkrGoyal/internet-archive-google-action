/**
 * Async Albums feeder
 * it fetches data on-demand
 *
 * pros:
 * - memory (user's state) efficient, because loads only needed songs
 * - could deal with very large of unlimited list of songs
 *
 * cons:
 * - could have delay on songs swapping
 * - could lack of information about real size of playlist
 *
 * TODO:
 * right now it just download big chunk of songs and
 * simulates async behaviour.
 *
 * btw it isn't covered by tests because right now we have
 * simplified implementation
